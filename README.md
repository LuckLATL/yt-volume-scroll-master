YouTube Volume Scroll Master is a small extension designed to simplify changing the volume in YouTube videos.

Scroll over the YouTube video player to increase or decrease its volume by two levels. That's it. That's all this extension can do. 

If the extension doesn't work, reload the website. This may be because the website (the video player, to be exact) is taking too long to load and the events are not subscribing to the video player correctly.
